NAME:    elf_init

PURPOSE:
   Initializes system variables for elf. Currently the variable only contains information
   on lomo elfin local data directory. Lot's more features should be added. See thm_init
   for examples.

NOTE:
   The system variable !ELF is defined here, just like !THEMIS.
   The elements of this structure are explained below:

   !MMS.LOCAL_DATA_DIR    This is the root location for all MMS data files.
                  The MMS software expects all data files to reside in specific subdirectories relative
                  to this root directory.;

   !MMS.REMOTE_DATA_DIR   This is not implemented yet because there is no server at this point in time. 
                  A URL will most likely be available after launch. 

KEYWORDS:
   RESET:           Reset !mms to values in environment (or values in keywords).
   LOCAL_DATA_DIR:  use given value for local_data_dir, rather than environment. Only works on
                    initial call or reset.
   REMOTE_DATA_DIR: Not yet implemented. 
   NO_COLOR_SETUP   do not set colors if already taken care of

NAME: 
  elf_load_data
           This routine loads local ELFIN Lomonosov data. 
           There is no server available yet so all files must
           be local. The default value is currently set to
          'C:/data/lomo/elfin/l1/'
          If you do not want to place your cdf files there you 
          must change the elfin system variable !elf.local_data_dir = 'yourdirectorypath'
KEYWORDS (commonly used by other load routines):
  INSTRUMENT = options are 'fgm', 'epd', 'eng' (This will probably change
               after launch 
  DATATYPE = This is not yet implemented and may not be needed
  LEVEL    = This is not yet implemented but options will  most likely include 
             levels 1 or 2. For Elfin lomo fgm will be the only instrument
             that has level 2 data. epd and eng only have level 1. Levels
             have also not been implemented in the load panel gui. 
  TRANGE   = (Optional) Time range of interest  (2 element array), if
             this is not set, the default is to prompt the user. Note
             that if the input time range is not a full day, a full
             day's data is loaded
          
EXAMPLE:
   elf_load_data,probe='x'
 
NOTES:
   Elfin lomo has not launched yet so naming conventions and file types
   and levels will most likely change.
   Since there is no data server - yet - files must reside locally.
   Current file naming convention is lomo_APID_APIDNAME_YYMMDD.cdf.
   It possible the Elfin load data gui will also include other missions
   and this should be kept in mind as this routine is expanded.

NAME:
  elf_load_eng
           This routine loads local ELFIN ENG Lomonosov data.
KEYWORDS (commonly used by other load routines):
  DATATYPE = (Currently downloads all data types. Should change that.)
  LEVEL    = levels include 1 (2 will be available shortly)
  TRANGE   = (Optional) Time range of interest  (2 element array), if
             this is not set, the default is to prompt the user. Note
             that if the input time range is not a full day, a full
             day's data is loaded
  LOCAL_DATA_DIR = local directory to store the CDF files; should be set if
             you're on *nix or OSX, the default currently assumes the IDL working directory
  SOURCE   = sets a different system variable. By default the MMS mission system variable
             is !elf
  TPLOTNAMES = set to override default names for tplot variables
  NO_UPDATES = use local data only, don't query the http site for updated files.
  SUFFIX   = append a suffix to tplot variables names

EXAMPLE:
   elf_load_eng, trange=['2016-06-24', '2016-06-25']

NOTES:
  Need to add feature to handle more than one days worth of data
  Need to add feature to delete variables that weren't requested by the user

NAME:
  elf_load_epd
           This routine loads local ELFIN EPD Lomonosov data.
