CRIB for managing color tables and line colors and taking control of colors in tplot

ROUTINES:
   initct : Wrapper for loadct2 and loadcsv.  Works the same way as loadct2 and loadcsv,
            but provides access to both sets of color tables.  Provides keywords for 
            setting line colors.  The previous routines still exist and can still be 
            called as before, so there's no need to modify any code unless you want to.
   showct : Display the current color table or any color table with any line color scheme.
   revvid : Swaps the values of !p.background and !p.color.
   line_colors : Choose one of ten predefined line color schemes, or define a custom scheme.
   get_line_colors : Returns a 3x8 array of the current line colors [[R,G,B],[R,G,B], ...].
                     Can also return the 3x8 array for any line color scheme.

   See the headers of these routines for more details.

   Tplot assumes that there are 256 RGB colors, organized as follows:

       Color           Purpose                             Modify With
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
         0             black (or any dark color)           initct, line_colors
        1-6            fixed line colors                   initct, line_colors
        7-254          color table (bottom_c to top_c)     initct
        255            white (or any light color)          initct, line_colors
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Colors 0 and 255 are usually associated with !p.background and !p.color.  For a light
   background, set !p.background = 255 and !p.color = 0.  Do the opposite for a dark
   background.  Use revvid to toggle between these options.

   The standard catalog has table numbers from 0 to 74, while the CSV catalog has table 
   numbers from 0 to 118.  These ranges overlap, so we need some way to separate them.  
   I chose to add 1000 to the CSV table numbers, so CSV table 78 becomes 1078, etc.
   There is also substantial overlap in the tables themselves:

        Standard Tables      CSV Tables       Note
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
            0 - 40           1000 - 1040      identical or nearly so
           41 - 43           1041 - 1043      different
           44 - 74           1044 - 1074      identical
             N/A             1075 - 1118      unique to CSV
      ----------------------------------------------------------------

   When tables are &quot;nearly identical&quot;, only a few colors are different.  The nearly identical
   tables are: [24, 29, 30, 38, 39, 40] &lt;-&gt; [1024, 1029, 1030, 1038, 1039, 1040].  So, apart
   from a few slight differences, there are 122 unique tables.

   As of this writing, there are 11 predefined line color schemes:

        0  : primary and secondary colors [black, magenta, blue, cyan, green, yellow, red, white]
       1-4 : four different schemes suitable for colorblind vision
        5  : same as 0, except orange replaces yellow for better contrast on white
        6  : same as 0, except gray replaces yellow for better contrast on white
        7  : https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1618, except no reddish purple
        8  : https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1618, except no yellow
        9  : same as 8 but permuted so vector defaults are blue, orange, reddish purple
       10  : Chaffin's CSV line colors, suitable for colorblind vision

   More schemes can be added by including them in the case statement of get_line_colors().  It's
   helpful if you can add a note about your scheme.

   Tplot has been modified to use initct and line_colors, so you can set custom color tables
   and line color schemes for individual tplot variables using options.

FUNCTION get_line_colors
   Get the current line colors, or line colors specified by input and/or keyword.
   Returns the result as an array of 24 (3x8) RGB colors: [[R,G,B], [R,G,B], ...].
   This DOES NOT alter the color table or assert any new line colors.  To do that
   you would pass the result of this routine to line_colors.pro or as an option
   for a tplot variable.

   To set custom line colors for any tplot panel do one of the following:

       lines = n  ; where 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 10
       options, varname, 'line_colors', lines

       lines = get_line_colors(line_clrs, KEYWORD=value, ...)
       options, varname, 'line_colors', lines

   To disable custom line colors for a tplot variable:

       options, varname, 'line_colors', -1

INPUTS:
   line_clrs : This input is optional.  Can take one of two forms:

   (1) Integer array of 24 (3x8) RGB values: [[R,G,B], [R,G,B], ...] that defines the
       first 7 colors (0-6) and the last (255).  Tplot assumes the following:

         Index           Purpose
        --------------------------------------------------
           0             black (or any dark color)
          1-6            fixed line colors
          7-254          color table (bottom_c to top_c)
          255            white (or any light color)
        --------------------------------------------------

       Indices 0 and 255 are associated with !p.background and !p.color.  For a light
       background, set !p.background = 255 and !p.color = 0.  Do the opposite for a
       dark background.  Use revvid to toggle between these options.

   (2) Integer that selects one of the predefined color schemes:

           0  : primary and secondary colors [black, magenta, blue, cyan, green, yellow, red, white]
          1-4 : four different schemes suitable for colorblind vision
           5  : same as 0, except orange replaces yellow for better contrast on white
           6  : same as 0, except gray replaces yellow for better contrast on white
           7  : see https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1618 except no reddish purple
           8  : see https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1618 except no yellow
           9  : same as 8 but permuted so vector defaults are blue, orange, reddish purple
          10  : Chaffin's CSV line colors, suitable for colorblind vision

   If there is no input and no keywords are set, this routine returns the current
   line colors.

KEYWORDS:
   COLOR_NAMES: String array of 8 line color names.  You must use line color names 
       recognized by spd_get_color().  RGB values for unrecognized color names are 
       set to zero.  Note that named colors are approximated by the nearest RGB 
       neighbors in the currently loaded color table.  This can work OK for rainbow
       color tables, but for tables that primarily encode intensity, the actual 
       colors can be quite different from the requested ones.

   MYCOLORS: A structure defining up to 8 custom colors.  This provides an alternate 
       method of poking individual custom colors into color indices (0-6 and 255).

              { ind    : up to 8 integers (0-6 or 255)              , $
                rgb    : up to 8 RGB levels [[R,G,B], [R,G,B], ...]    }

       The indicies (ind) specified in this structure will replace one or more of the
       current line colors.  You are not allowed to change color indices 7-254, because
       those are reserved for the color table.  Indices 0 and 255 allow you to define 
       custom background and foreground colors.

   GRAYBKG: Set color index 255 to gray [211,211,211] instead of white.  See keyword
       MYCOLORS for a general method of setting any line color to any RGB value.
       For example, GRAYBKG=1 is equivalent to MYCOLORS={ind:255, rgb:[211,211,211]}.

       To actually use this color for the background, you must set !p.background=255
       (normally combined with !p.color=0).

common blocks:
   colors:      IDL color common block.  Many IDL routines rely on this.

PROCEDURE:   initct
PURPOSE:
  Wrapper for loadct2 and loadcsv.  Calls the appropriate color table 
  routine based on the requested table number:

      table numbers &lt; 1000  (currently 0-74)      : use loadct2
      table numbers &gt;= 1000 (currently 1000-1118) : use loadcsv

  There is substantial overlap between the standard and CSV tables:

      Standard Tables      CSV Tables       Note
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
          0 - 40           1000 - 1040      identical or nearly so
         41 - 43           1041 - 1043      different
         44 - 74           1044 - 1074      identical
           N/A             1075 - 1118      unique to CSV
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

  When tables are &quot;nearly identical&quot;, only a few colors are different.
  The nearly identical tables are: [24, 29, 30, 38, 39, 40] &lt;-&gt; 
  [1024, 1029, 1030, 1038, 1039, 1040].  So, apart from a few slight 
  differences, there are 122 unique tables.

  Keywords are provided to define fixed colors that are used for lines
  (1-6), and the background and foreground colors (0,255).
  ** Once set, these fixed colors are persistent until explicitly changed.

  Use line_colors.pro to change the fixed colors without affecting the rest
  of the color table.

  Use get_line_colors() to return a 3x8 array containing either the current
  line colors or custom colors specified by input and keyword.  This can be
  used to set custom line colors for a tplot variable.  See get_line_colors
  for details.

USAGE:
  initct, colortbl [, KEYWORD=value, ...]

INPUTS:
       colortbl:     Color table number.  If less than 1000, call loadct2
                     to load one of the standard color tables.  If greater
                     than or equal to 1000, call loadcsv to load one of
                     the CSV color tables.  Required.  No default.

KEYWORDS:
       REVERSE:      If set, reverse the color table (indices 7-254).

       LINE_CLRS:    Defines custom line colors.  Can take one of two forms:

                     (1) Array of 24 (3x8) RGB values that define 8 fixed colors 
                         (the first 7 and the last) of the color table:
                         LINE_CLRS = [[R,G,B], [R,G,B], ...].

                     (2) Integer that selects a predefined color scheme:

                         0  : primary and secondary colors
                        1-4 : four different schemes suitable for colorblind vision
                         5  : same as 0, except orange replaces yellow for better contrast on white
                         6  : same as 0, except gray replaces yellow for better contrast on white
                         7  : https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1618 except no reddish purple
                         8  : https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1618 except no yellow
                         9  : same as 8 but permuted so vector defaults are blue, orange, reddish purple
                        10  : Chaffin's CSV line colors, suitable for colorblind vision

                         See get_line_colors() for RGB values of predefined schemes.
                         The most recent color schemes may not be documented here.

       COLOR_NAMES:  String array of 8 line color names.  You must use line color
                     names recognized by spd_get_color().  RGB values for unrecognized
                     color names are set to zero.  Not recommended, because named 
                     colors are approximated by the nearest RGB neighbors in the 
                     currently loaded color table.  This can work OK for rainbow color
                     tables, but for tables that primarily encode intensity, the 
                     actual colors can be quite different from the requested ones.
                     Included for backward compatibility.

       MYCOLORS:     A structure defining up to 8 custom colors.  These are 
                     fixed colors used to draw colored lines (1-6) and to define
                     the background (0) and foreground (255) colors.

                     { ind : up to 8 integers (0-6 or 255)              , $
                       rgb : up to 8 RGB levels [[R,G,B], [R,G,B], ...]    }

                     The indicies (ind) specified in MYCOLORS will replace one or
                     more of the default colors.  You are not allowed to change
                     color indices 7-254, because those are reserved for the
                     color table.  Indices 0 and 255 allow you to define custom
                     background and foreground colors.

       GRAYBKG:      Set color index 255 to gray [211,211,211] instead of white.
                     See keyword MYCOLORS for a general method of setting any line 
                     color to any RGB value.  For example, GRAYBKG=1 is equivalent 
                     to MYCOLORS={ind:255, rgb:[211,211,211]}.

                     To actually use this color for the background, you must set 
                     !p.background=255 (normally combined with !p.color=0).
                     A quick way to do this:  revvid, /white

       PREVIOUS_CT:  Named variable to hold the previous color table number.
                     Use this to temporarily change the color table and then return
                     to the previous one.  Tplot needs this to change color tables
                     on the fly.

       PREVIOUS_REV: Named variable to hold the previous color reverse.
                     Use this to temporarily change the color table and then return
                     to the previous one.  Tplot needs this to change color tables
                     on the fly.

       SHOW:         Show the color table in a separate window after loading.

       SUPPRESS:     Suppress floating overflow error in first call to window.

PROCEDURE line_colors
   Alters one or more of the fixed colors (indices 0-6 and 255) without changing
   the color table.  This includes the line colors (1-6) and the background (0) 
   and foreground (255) colors.

INPUTS:
   line_clrs : Can take one of two forms:

   (1) Integer array of 24 (3x8) RGB values: [[R,G,B], [R,G,B], ...] that defines
       the first 7 colors (0-6) and the last (255).

   (2) Integer that selects a predefined color scheme:

           0  : primary colors
          1-4 : four different schemes suitable for colorblind vision
           5  : primary colors, except orange replaces yellow for better contrast on white
           6  : primary colors, except gray replaces yellow for better contrast on white
           7  : https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1618, except no reddish purple
           8  : https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1618, except no yellow
           9  : same as 8 but permuted so vector defaults are blue, orange, reddish purple
          10  : Chaffin's CSV line colors, suitable for colorblind vision

    To set custom line colors for any tplot panel:

       options, varname, 'line_colors', lines

    where the value of lines is one of the formats above.

KEYWORDS:
    COLOR_NAMES:  String array of 8 line color names.  You must use line color
                  names recognized by spd_get_color().  RGB values for unrecognized
                  color names are set to zero.  Not recommended, because named 
                  colors are approximated by the nearest RGB neighbors in the 
                  currently loaded color table.  This can work OK for rainbow color
                  tables, but for tables that primarily encode intensity, the 
                  actual colors can be quite different from the requested ones.
                  Included for backward compatibility.

    MYCOLORS:     A structure defining up to 8 custom colors.  These are fixed
                  colors used to draw colored lines (1-6) and to define the
                  background (0) and foreground (255) colors.

                     { ind    : up to 8 integers (0-6 or 255)              , $
                       rgb    : up to 8 RGB levels [[R,G,B], [R,G,B], ...]    }

                  The indicies (ind) specified in MYCOLORS will replace one or
                  more of the default colors.  You are not allowed to change
                  color indices 7-254, because those are reserved for the
                  color table.  Indices 0 and 255 allow you to define custom
                  background and foreground colors.  For example, the following
                  chooses color scheme 5, but sets the background color to light
                  gray with a black foreground (pen) color:

                     line_colors, 5, mycolors={ind:255, rgb:[211,211,211]}
                     !p.color = 0
                     !p.background = 255

    GRAYBKG:      Set color index 255 to gray [211,211,211] instead of white.
                  See keyword MYCOLORS for a general method of setting any line 
                  color to any RGB value.  For example, GRAYBKG=1 is equivalent 
                  to MYCOLORS={ind:255, rgb:[211,211,211]}.

                  To actually use this color for the background, you must set 
                  !p.background=255 (normally combined with !p.color=0).

    PREVIOUS_LINES: Named variable to hold the previous line colors.
                 Tplot needs this to swap line colors on the fly.

SEE ALSO:
    get_line_colors() : Works like this routine, but returns a 24 element array
                  instead of asserting the new line colors.  Allows you to define
                  a custom set of line colors in a format that you can use with
                  tplot options.
    initct :      Loads a color table without changing the line colors, except by
                  keyword.

common blocks:
   colors:      IDL color common block.  Many IDL routines rely on this.

PROCEDURE loadct2, colortable
   By default LOADCT2 uses the same color table used by LOADCT
   This can be changed in 3 ways:
   1) Use the FILE keyword to define a new file
   2) Define the environment variable IDL_CT_FILE to point to a new file
   3) Place a new color table file in the same directory as LOADCT2 that matches
         the name: 'colors*.tbl'.  (The last file found with file_search is used).

   This routine now uses get_line_colors() to define the eight fixed RGB colors for
   drawing lines and setting the background and foreground colors.  All line color 
   keywords work as before but are now passed to that function.  Please place any
   new line color schemes in get_line_colors().

INPUTS:
   colortable: Color table number.  Required.

KEYWORDS:
   REVERSE: If set, then reverse the table order from bottom_c to top_c.
   PREVIOUS_CT: Needed by tplot to change color tables on the fly.
   PREVIOUS_REV: Needed by tplot to change color tables on the fly.
   FILE:  (string) Color table file
          If FILE is not provided then LOADCT2
          Uses the environment variable IDL_CT_FILE to determine
          the color table file if FILE is not set.
   LINE_CLRS: Integer array of 24 (3x8) RGB values: [[R,G,B], [R,G,B], ...]
          If this input does not have exactly 24 elements, then a predefined set of 8 colors
          will be used based on the value of the first element.  Pre-defined color schemes
          are currently (see code below for any new undocumented schemes):
             0  : primary colors
            1-4 : four different schemes suitable for colorblind vision
             5  : primary colors, except orange replaces yellow for better contrast on white
             6  : primary colors, except gray replaces yellow for better contrast on white
             7  : see https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1618 except no reddish purple
             8  : see https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1618 except no yellow
             9  : same as 8 but permuted so vector defaults are blue, orange, reddish purple
            10  : Chaffin's CSV line colors, suitable for colorblind vision
   LINE_COLOR_NAMES:  String array of 8 line color names.  You must use line color names
          recognized by spd_get_color().  RGB values for unrecognized color names are set
          to zero.  Note that named colors are approximated by the nearest RGB neighbors in 
          the currently loaded color table.  This can work OK for rainbow color tables, but 
          for tables that primarily encode intensity, the actual colors can be quite different
          from the requested ones.  Included for backward compatibility.
   COLOR_NAMES: Synonym for LINE_COLOR_NAMES.  Allows better keyword minimum matching, if the
          previous keyword can be retired.  Both keywords are accepted - this one takes precedence.
   MYCOLORS:
          A structure defining up to 8 custom colors.  This provides an alternate method of
          poking individual custom colors into the fixed color indices (0-6 and 255).

            { ind  : up to 8 integers (0-6 or 255)              , $
              rgb  : up to 8 RGB levels [[R,G,B], [R,G,B], ...]    }

          You can also specify LINE_CLRS and LINE_COLOR_NAMES, and this keyword can make further
          adjustments.

          The indicies (ind) specified in MYCOLORS will replace one or more of these
          colors.  You are not allowed to change color indices 7-254, because those
          are reserved for the color table.  Indices 0 and 255 allow you to define 
          custom foreground and background colors.
   GRAYBKG: Set color index 255 to gray [211,211,211] instead of white.
          See keyword MYCOLORS for a general method of setting any line color to any RGB value.
          For example, GRAYBKG=1 is equivalent to MYCOLORS={ind:255, rgb:[211,211,211]}.
          To actually use this color for the background, you must set !p.background=255
          (normally combined with !p.color=0).
   RGB_TABLE: Named variable that returns the current 3x8 line color table.
